DNA Toolkit
Welcome to the DNA Toolkit! This repository is my introduction to bioinformatics, providing essential tools for DNA sequence analysis and manipulation.

Features
DNA Sequence Validation: Ensures the integrity of DNA sequences.
Base Counting: Counts the occurrences of each nucleotide (A, T, C, G).
Transcription: Converts DNA sequences to RNA.
Reverse Complement: Generates the reverse complement of a DNA sequence.
GC Content Calculation: Calculates the GC content of a DNA sequence.
Installation
To use the DNA Toolkit, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies.
# git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dna-toolkit.git
# cd dna-toolkit
# pip install -r requirements.txt

# from dna_toolkit import DNA_Toolkit

# Example DNA sequence
sequence = "ATCGGCTAAGCT"

# Validate sequence
valid = DNA_Toolkit.validate_sequence(sequence)
print(f"Sequence is valid: {valid}")

# Count bases
base_count = DNA_Toolkit.count_bases(sequence)
print(f"Base counts: {base_count}")

# Transcription
rna_sequence = DNA_Toolkit.transcribe(sequence)
print(f"RNA sequence: {rna_sequence}")

# Reverse complement
reverse_complement = DNA_Toolkit.reverse_complement(sequence)
print(f"Reverse complement: {reverse_complement}")

# GC Content
gc_content = DNA_Toolkit.gc_content(sequence)
print(f"GC Content: {gc_content:.2f}%")
